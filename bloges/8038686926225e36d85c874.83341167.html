                One of the most common mistakes people make is underestimate the importance of visual content on their site. How important is it exactly to have pictures that are accurate and appealing to your customers?
            </p>
            <p>
                Humans are visual beings, we process information based on what we see. Studies show that <strong>people remember 80% of what they see and 20% of what they read.</strong> Answer the above question?
            </p>
            <p>
                According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180829005092/en/New-Research-ViSenze-Finds-62-Percent-Generation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study by ViSenze</a>, 62% of generation Z and millennial customers want visual search capabilities when shopping online. It’s often repeated in business circles that the future of search will be about pictures, not keywords. Instead of searching via words, users can snap a photo of clothes, furniture, home décor, anything at all really without having to describe what they are looking for. You can do this today via <a href="https://lens.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Lens</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="images/blog-image.png" class="image">

                Talking about visual, the most important visual asset for your eCommerce site are the images of your products. <strong>Great images can increase your sales.</strong> Here are some basic tips on what good product photography can look like.
            </p>
            <p class="h2">
                Minimalism and simplicity is key
            </p>
            <p>
                For standard eCommerce photography, your product should be in focus. Period.
            </p>
            <p>
                Avoid having too many visual elements in the same photo, just keep to the product on a solid white, gray or light-colored background. One trick is to brighten the background and remove any shadows so that the users attention is focused squarely on the product you are selling.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to an Amazon study, 22% of online product returns are because the ordered items look different than in the photos. It is imperative that the photos are realistic and not overly edited, spoiling the product’s look. Also, minimize the number of elements on your webpage that grab your shopper’s attention away.
            </p>
            <p class="h2">
                Consider alternate views
            </p>
            <p>
                The more visual information a customer has, the more likely he or she is to buy the product. A general recommendation is to have 4-6 photos of your product from different angles (front, top, bottom and sides). The product should take no less than 75% of the available space on the photo, but not more than 90%.
            </p>
            <p class="h2">
                Invest in a good photography service for the best photos
            </p>
            <p>
                High quality product photos show customers you are serious about your business and allow them to trust you. But great photos don’t mean anything if they take too much time to load. In that case, your bounce rate would be off the charts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be careful about image sizes (bigger is not always better), any image that takes more than 2 seconds to load will not give desired results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lots of small businesses think that hiring a professional photographer is a wasteful expense and would rather take photos themselves. This is actually wrong and will hurt you more in missed selling opportunities, trust deficit with your targeted customers and overall loss to your business. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Product photography is a specialized function, make sure you hire the right professional and enjoy blur, nose and pixelation free images.
            </p>
            <p class="h2">
                Consistency is key
            </p>
            <p>
                Plan in detail what every set of photos should look like, from the background to lighting, editing and the creation of a unique template. Every product should be photographed using the same framework to ensure that your customers have a seamless experience and can quickly compare products to find what they are looking for.
            </p>
            <p class="h2">
                Have unique images       
            </p>
            <p>
                To properly rank and optimize images for websites, it is preferable that the images you have are unique and original. If a site features unoriginal photos of products, users could potentially be redirected to different websites featuring the same products with nothing to differentiate them. <strong>When merchants create unique images, they stand out from others.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p class="h2">
                Did you know that the images on your site, including product photos can contribute to your SEO?
            </p>
            <p>
                Optimizing your product images and photos for Google and other search engines is a great way to gain interested customers for your products. Here’s how you can do it:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li class="list">
                    <strong>Name your image file.</strong> When naming photos, use short words that are accurate and descriptive. Avoid too long file names or keyword “stuffing” as that could have a negative impact on your ranking
                </li>
                <li class="list">
                    <strong>Alt text on images.</strong> Search engines have a hard time interpreting images, they depend mostly on the file name and the alternative (Alt) text. The purpose of alt text is to allow Google to read and understand images better so that they can be displayed to relevant users
                </li>
                <li class="list">
                    <strong>Image size and types.</strong> Use new image formats like Webp to have high quality images with a smaller file size. Also size your image appropriately so that time to render the webpage is not adversely impacted. Long page load times equate to lost sales.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="toppad">
                No matter how amazing your products are, having compelling photos is critical to your success. You have to bear in mind that buyers can’t touch or hold your products in their hands, they only have the photos.
