                <p>The Service includes certain features that are available via a mobile device, including (but not limited to)</p>

By using mobile services, you agree that we may communicate with you regarding Pyx and other entities via SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic means. In the event that you change your mobile number, you agree to promptly update your Pyx account information to ensure that messages are not sent to the person who acquires your old number.</p>
                <p><h6>Matching</h6></p>
                <p>Pyx endeavors to match Subjects with the most suitable Photographer(s) based on the information provided by the Subject. A number of Photographers may be presented as options to a Subject as part of the matching process, in which case it’s the Subject’s responsibility to make the final choice as to which Photographer provides the requested photography services.</p>
                <p>A Subject will be able to book photography services through the site/ application. However, even when a Photographer is matched with or chosen by a Subject for a booking, Pyx reserves the right to change which Photographer actually provides the Services for a particular booking in its sole discretion. Pyx will endeavor to inform the Subject of any such change in advance.</p>
                <p><h5>Photographer terms</h5></p>
                <p><h6>No off-platform activity</h6></p>
                <p>As Photographer, you may not induce Subjects to receive Services similar to the photography services offered by Pyx off the site. You acknowledge and agree that a substantial portion of the compensation Pyx receives for making the site available to you is collected through the Pyx fee described in Payment Terms. Pyx only receives this fee when a Subject and Photographer pay and receive payments through the site.</p>
                <p>During the non-circumvention period of 12 months following each shoot, you acknowledge and agree not to contact the Subject for any photography need off the Pyx platform. Failure to not do so, will result in a fine of INR 1,00,000 (Rupees One Lac) per off-platform relationship and suspension/ deactivation off the Pyx platform.</p>
                <p>To pay the off-platform activity penalty, you must request instructions by contacting Pyx using our <a href="contact.html">Contact Us form</a>.</p>
                <p><h6>Confidentiality</h6></p>
                <p>Photographer agrees that certain confidential information (including, but not limited to photography guides, information packages, computer programs, training guides, technical drawings, algorithms, know-how, formulas, processes, ideas, inventions (whether patentable or not), schematics and other technical, business, financial, customer and product development plans, forecasts, strategies and information) that the Photographer learns about or obtains in connection with the Service, constitute “Proprietary Information”. Photographer will hold in confidence and disclose or, except in the performance of contracted Services, use any proprietary information.</p>
                <p>Photographer will prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of the proprietary information using at least the same degree of care as the Photographer uses to protect his/ her own most sensitive information. Upon termination of association or as requested by Pyx, the Photographer will promptly return all items and copies containing or embodying proprietary information.</p>
                <p><h6>Other photographer obligations</h6></p>
                <p>As a Photographer, you must provide Pyx with any information requested in order for Pyx to match you with a Subject, such as information on your background, experience and skills, sample photos taken by you, contact details and your headshot. You must also provide Pyx with up to date, complete and accurate information regarding the days and times you are available to complete bookings and must ensure that this information remains accurate and current at all times. Once you are matched with the Subject, you have the right to turn down the job, but Pyx has the sole discretion to determine if such a refusal will harm your ability to be matched in the future. Pyx may also request that you submit a portfolio of previous works. Pyx has sole discretion as to which Photographers are accepted into the marketplace and we reserve the right to reject any potential Photographer and remove any Photographer from the marketplace at any time.</p>
                <p>EACH PHOTOGRAPHER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING ALL APPLICABLE PERMITS, LICENSES AND OTHER PERMISSIONS REQUIRED TO OFFER OR PROVIDE ANY PHOTOGRAPHY SERVICES. PYX ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR A PHOTOGRAPHER’S FAILURE TO OBTAIN SUCH PERMITS, LICENSES OR PERMISSIONS OR OTHERWISE COMPLY WITH ANY APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS.</p>
                <p>Nothing in this agreement will in any way be construed to constitute Photographer as an agent, employee or representative of Pyx, but the Photographer will perform the Services hereunder as an independent contractor. Photographer acknowledges and agrees that the Photographer is obligated to report as income all compensation received by the Photographer pursuant to this agreement, and Photographer agrees and acknowledges the obligation to pay all self-employment and other taxes thereon and that he will not be eligible for any employee benefits (nor does he desire any of them) and expressly waives any entitlement to such benefits. Photographer acknowledges and agrees that he will use his own discretion in performing the tasks assigned, within the scope of work specified by the company.</p>
                <p>You understand and agree that Pyx is neither an insurer, nor a contracting agent or employer for you as a Photographer. If the Subject purchases any of your photography services, any agreement you enter into with such Subject is between you and the Subject; and Pyx is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pyx serves as your limited authorized agent for the purpose of collecting payments from Subjects on your behalf and Pyx is responsible for transmitting your portion of such payments to you. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Photographer, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions. You understand that Pyx does not offer any medical coverage for bodily harm or injury that may result from providing the photography services. Pyx will not reimburse for any medical bills, transportation or loss of wages as a result of the injury or for any accommodations.</p>
                <p>Pyx will have the sole discretion to issue a monetary penalty to a Photographer, if</p>
                <ul class="ul-text">
                    <li>The Photographer cancels a shoot with the Subject without reasonable notice</li>
                    <li>Does not show up for a scheduled shoot with a Subject</li>
                    <li>Otherwise fails to perform obligations through no fault of Pyx or the Subject</li>
                </ul>
                <p><h5>Payment Terms</h5></p>
                <p><h6>General</h6></p>
                <p>Each Subject agrees to pay all applicable fees for photography services and fees for any digital downloads or prints purchased either through a package or after the completion of the photography services (“Purchased Prints”) as set forth on the site (collectively, “Photographer Fees”). All Photographer fees are payable in the currency specified on the site at the time of the booking. If a Subject requests amended photography services, including but not limited to change in shoot time, location, duration or type of photography needed, a change fee may be charged. ALL CHANGE FEES ARE PAYABLE BEFORE ANY AMENDMENTS ARE MADE TO THE PHOTOSHOOT AND PERFORMED.</p>
                <p>Pyx may also charge fees to Subjects for use of the Services (the “Service Fee”). This “Service Fee” is equivalent to 5% of the Photographer fees. Pyx reserves the right to change the Service Fee at any time, and will provide Subjects with notice of any change to the Service fee before such change takes effect by updating the Terms of Service. Changes to the service fee will not affect any booking made prior to the effective date of the change.</p>
                <p>Except as stated otherwise expressly in writing by Pyx in its sole approval, all payments made are final and non-refundable and the Subject shall not have the right to cancel its purchase for any reason. If you make payment by credit card or any other payment instrument, you represent and warrant to the company that such information is true and you are authorized to use said payment instrument. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. You agree to pay the company the final amount specified on the site for Photographer fees and in accordance with the terms of such fees and purchases, and this “Terms of Service”.</p>
                <p><h6>Photographer payment</h6></p>
                <p>Pyx will facilitate bi-monthly payment (on the 1st and 15th of each month) to a Photographer’s nominated bank account the total photographer fees accrued for the photographer services provided to a Subject by such Photographer during the preceding payment period, less any fee payable to Pyx for referring the Subject(s) to such Photographer as set forth in the terms provided to Photographers at the time of their onboarding (“Pyx fees”). Pyx has sole discretion to act on behalf of the Subject, and not pay photographer fees if the Subject reports that the photography services were not provided or adequately completed. This may include but is not limited to circumstances where a Photographer did not arrive for a booking or photos were of insufficient quality for use. Pyx will independently review such cases, seeking input from the Subject and/ or the Photographer in its sole discretion, and may decide to issue a refund to the Subject.</p>
                <p><h6>Limited payment collections agent</h6></p>
                <p>Each Photographer agrees to appoint Pyx as the Photographer’s limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Photographer’s fees from the Subject. Each User agrees that payment of photography fees in respect of a Photographer by a Subject to Pyx, as that Photographer’s limited payment collection agent, shall be considered the same as a payment made directly by that Subject to the relevant Photographer and that the Photographer shall provide the relevant photography Services to the Subject, as outlined on our site, as if the Photographer had received the payment directly. Pyx, as a limited payment collection agent for the Photographer, agrees to facilitate the payment of any Photographer fees for photography Services provided, on a bi-monthly basis unless otherwise agreed to between the Photographer and Pyx. In the event that Pyx does not remit such amounts, the Photographer will have recourse only against Pyx.</p>
                <p><h5>Conditions of use</h5></p>
                <p>User conduct</p>
                <p>You are solely responsible for all code, video, images, information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, messages or other materials (“content”) that you upload, post, publish or display (hereinafter, “upload”) or email or otherwise use via the Service.
